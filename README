INSTALL
------------------------------

By default Clay is linked with Clan, Candl and Cloog. This is useful to run
Clay with the -c (compile) option. 

If Clan, Cloog (need Osl), Candl, OSL..., are not present on your system 
use the bundled option in the redo.sh and run the get_submodules.sh

Edit the redo.sh to modify the configuration.


  - linked with Clan and ClooG
    -c : input  : .c file
         output : .c file

  - linked with Clan
    --readc : input : .c file

  - linked with ClooG
    --printc : output : .c file

  - linked with Candl 
    Warning: Candl need to be compiled with Piplib in GMP, because Cloog is
    only compatible with GMP (change the variable BITS in the configure of
    Candl).
    If there is a violation, the violation graph is printed otherwise it's the 
    result (scop or .c file).
    You can use the --nocandl to not check dependencies.


Installation:
$ ./redo.sh
$ make install

Alternative installation with CMake:
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake .. # -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="/your/install/directory"
$ make
$ make test
$ # make install # sudo make install # su -c "make install"
$ make doc
$ make doxygen
