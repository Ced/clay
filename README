INSTALL
------------------------------

By default Clay is linked with Clan, Candl and Cloog. This is useful to run
Clay with the -c (compile) option. 
If Clan, Cloog, Candl, OSL..., are not present use the bundled option in the
redo.sh and run the get_submodules.sh

- linked only with Clan
  -c : input  : .c file
       output : scop

- linked only with Cloog (libcloog-isl), Cloog need to be compiled with Osl !
  -c : input  : scop
       output : optimized .c file

- linked with Clan and Cloog
  -c : input  : .c file
       output : optimized .c file

- linked with Candl 
	Warning: Candl need to be compiled with Piplib in GMP, because Cloog is only
	compatible with GMP (change the variable BITS in the configure of Candl)
  You can use the --nocandl to not check dependencies.
  If it's also linked with Cloog, and if there are no violations the
	optimized .c file is printed, otherwise it's the violation graph.

Installation :
$ ./redo.sh
$ make install
